**Sema4.ai is on a mission to define the future of knowledge work by building intelligent agents that transform how knowledge workers collaborate with AI.** Everything we do is driven by three core beliefs:

- **Meaning is everything**: For the first time, LLMs enable intent to be programmable, allowing users to express and execute complex tasks using natural language. We build intelligent agents with semantic meaning at their core.
- **Action is essential**: Meaningful tasks require the ability to take action. In order for AI applications to expand beyond search use cases, they must be able to respond to real-world conditions and take action against enterprise systems.
- **Open source fuels innovation**: Every meaningful innovation in the data, AI, and application space has unfolded in the open. We're building a vibrant, inclusive community that gives AI application developers and automation engineers the tools needed to push the boundaries of human-AI collaboration and expand what’s possible.
